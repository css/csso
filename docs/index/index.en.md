CSSO (CSS Optimizer) is a CSS minimizer unlike others. In addition to usual minification techniques it can perform structural optimization of CSS files, resulting in smaller file size compared to other minifiers.

## Minification (in a nutshell)

Safe transformations:

* Removal of whitespace
* Removal of trailing `;`
* Removal of comments
* Removal of invalid `@charset` and `@import` declarations
* Minification of color properties
* Minification of `0`
* Minification of multi-line strings
* Minification of the `font-weight` property

Structural optimizations:

* Merging blocks with identical selectors
* Merging blocks with identical properties
* Removal of overridden properties
* Removal of overridden shorthand properties
* Removal of repeating selectors
* Partial merging of blocks
* Partial splitting of blocks
* Removal of empty ruleset and at-rule
* Minification of `margin` and `padding` properties

The minification techniques are described in detail in the [detailed description](../description/description.en.md).
